### Sample Networks
***
Here, we provide several sample networks to investigate: 
- <b>Biogrid PPI</b> and <b>STRING PPI:</b> Protein-protein interactions (PPI) obtained from [Biogrid](https://thebiogrid.org/) and [STRING](https://string-db.org/). 
- <b>Biogrid PPI (Across Time)</b>:</b> This option uses 2020 version of the Biogrid PPI network as the training set and the new interactions in 2022 version as the test set. 
- <b>Drugbank DDI:</b> Drug-Drug interactions (DDI) from [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/). 
- <b>PSP KS:</b> Kinase-substrate (KS) associations from [PhosphositePlus](https://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction.action). This is a bipartite network between kinases and phosphosites. 
- <b>TRRUST TF:</b> Transcription factor (TF) regulatory relationships from [TRRUST](https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/). This is a bipartite network between TFs and their target genes. Only the interactions in positive direction (i.e., activation) are considered. 
- <b>CTD DDA</b> and <b>NDFRT DDA</b>: These are drug-disease associations (DDA) from [CTD](http://ctdbase.org/downloads/) and [NDFRT](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/NDFRT/). These are bipartite networks. 

For all networks, the benchmarking data (i.e., training/test splits) are generated by randomly sampling 10\% of the edges uniformly at random.
