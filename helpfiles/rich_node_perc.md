### Rich and Poor Nodes
***
Here, we separate the nodes into two categories based on the degrees in the network: 
- <b>Rich Nodes:</b> These are nodes with highest degrees in the network, representing the well-studied entities. The slider controls the size of this group. 
- <b>Poor Nodes:</b> These are the remaining nodes with low degrees, representing the under-studied biological entities. 

These categories are used for investigating the imbalance in the edge distribution of the network as well as the influence of the poor nodes on evaluation (for measuring prediction performance). Note that, the categories are not used for the separability analysis.
